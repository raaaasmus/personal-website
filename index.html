          <p><strong>Barren</strong> was a one-day project made on February 6th, 2017.
          It was around this time that I decided to challenge myself creatively
          at least once a month. With this project, I wanted to create
          a film with something that resembled a story, but left the meaning of it
          up to the viewer.<br /><br />The name of the film ended up being
          <strong>Barren</strong>, to represent the cold and dead feeling
          of a February in Sweden.</p>

          <p>Made during the September-December period of 2016, the short film
          <strong>Siren</strong> was made as a project for a film class I was taking at the time.
          I worked on this with Nawid Abed, who has his own YouTube channel
          over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MyPlaygroundMvm/" target="_blank">NawidVisuals</a>.
          <br /><br />I was the co-director and location sound manager on this project.</p>

          <p><strong>Consciousness</strong> was a video essay I made during
          December in 2016 for a class I was taking at the time. It analyzes
          the first season of Westworld and provides some questions for the viewer.</p>

          <p>For the mod <strong>The Code</strong>, I played the role of
          <em>Luke</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Mod Description:</strong> A strange broadcast pinpoints the
          location of three strangers in the Commonwealth, tangled up within a
          tenement building in the heart of Boston. Make friends, or enemies,
          explore, and discover, as you guide them to their destination.</p>
          <p><strong>Testemonial:</strong> <i><q>Rasmus has been super easy to work
          with! He was very prompt with the delivery of his files, the
          quality of which had been clean enough to where all I had to do
          was adjust volume levels to match the projects overall (which
          admittedly I did not provide him). He was happy to re-record one
          line when asked, as well. We would happily work with Rasmus
          again in the future!</q></i></p>

          I played the role of <em>Steve Clarke</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Mod Description:</strong> Join Director of Robotics,
          Hilda Hughes, as she investigates the Prototype Synth Project.
          In doing this, the player will be able to enter the memories of
          five pre-war citizens and then discover their post-war fates.
          However, all is not well in the Robotics Division. A synth has
          gone missing and Hilda isn't convinced it was a production error. </p>
          <p><strong>Testemonial:</strong> <i><q>Rasmus was very easy to work
          with. He took direction well and delivered his lines promptly,
          all of which were great quality. I didn't need any rerecorded but
          he was willing to do so if needed. Would definitely use him again.</q></i></p>
